# PyPoll
This is a repo containing my solution for the second challenge of homework #3.
+ + + + + + + 

The exercise was to analyze some voting data from an election in a fictitious small town.
The dataset had three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The final script will run in the terminal and print the results to a text file.
